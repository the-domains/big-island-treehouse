  This is the first weekly post of many that will document our efforts to build
  a house in the trees on the Big Island of Hawaii. My brother and I fly out in
  a couple of days to begin. That is where we’ll see if we can actually be
  successful and build an entire house by ourselves with absolutely no building
  experience whatsoever… Or if one of us ends up killing the other in the
  process for food. Either way, it will be fun.
